PyLaTeX [![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/JelteF/PyLaTeX.svg)]()
=======


PyLaTeX is a Python library for creating and compiling LaTeX files. The goal of
this library is being an easy, but extensible interface between Python and
LaTeX.


### Features

- Document generation and compilation
- Section, table, math, figure, matplotlib and package classes
- A matrix class that can compile NumPy ndarrays and matrices to LaTeX
- Very exstensible base classes that you can use to easily add new features
- Contextmanager style class hierarchy
- Functionality to escape special LaTeX characters
- Bold, italic and verbatim functions
- Every class has a dump method, which writes the output to a filepointer this
    way you can use snippets in in normal LaTeX files using `\input`

Everything else you want you can still add to the document by adding LaTeX
formatted strings to the container class you want it to be in.


### Dependencies

- Python 3.x or Python 2.7
- ordered-set

#### Optional dependencies

- pdflatex (only if you want to compile the tex file)
- NumPy (only if you want to convert it's matrixes)
- awkwardduet (only if you want to compile to python 2 source code yourself)


### Installation
`pip install pylatex`

### Future development

I will keep adding functionality I need to this library.

If you add a feature yourself, or fix a bug, please send a pull request. The
code is not very difficult and mostly speaks for itself. If you have a question
just let me know.

You can submit issues and I will probably respond quite quick. However, it might
take a lot more time for me to fix something. I also have a job, education and a
personal life to worry about. If you want something done try to fix it yourself
as well. Accepting pull requests costs way less time.

### Support

This library is being developed in and for Python 3. Because of a conversion
script the current version also works in Python 2.7. For future versions, no
such promise will be made. Python 3 features that are useful but incompatible
with Python 2 will be used. If you find a bug for Python 2 and it is fixable
without ugly hacks feel free to send a pull request.

The platform this library is developed for is Linux. I have no intention to
write fixes or test for platform specific bugs with every update. Pull requests
that fix those issues are always welcome though.
