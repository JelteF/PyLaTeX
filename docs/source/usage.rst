Library usage
=============

Understanding PyLaTeX
---------------------
PyLaTeX is structured around two main tasks: Generating LaTeX code, and
compiling LaTeX documents. The package is flexible, and can either work with your 
pre-existing code or generate new code with its system of classes. 
In turn, LaTeX code can be used to generate a document, or can be exported as-is.

The classes
-----------
PyLaTeX uses a set of classes to turn LaTeX document generation into a set of 
pythonic components. For example, a :py:class:`~pylatex.document.Document` 
might be comprised of :py:class:`~pylatex.section.Section` objects, 
which in turn might have :py:class:`~pylatex.lists.List` objects, 
:py:class:`~pylatex.lists.Figure` objects, or
custom :py:class:`~pylatex.base_classes.command.Command` objects. 

Classes can be part of a single document, or can act as pieces on their own.
With the :py:meth:`~pylatex.base_classes.latex_object.LatexObject.dumps` method,
most classes can return their LaTeX-formatted code, and with the 
:py:meth:`~pylatex.base_classes.latex_object.LatexObject.generate_tex` method,
this code can be written to a file.

Containers / Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A :py:class:`~pylatex.base_classes.containers.Container` is an object that 
groups other LaTeX classes. Containers function like lists; they can be
indexed and appended to.

One of the most important container classes is the
:py:class:`~pylatex.document.Document` class. Documents create a 
full LaTeX document that can create a PDF file with 
:py:meth:`~pylatex.document.Document.generate_pdf` . Unless you are only 
generating LaTeX snippets, you will likely want to enclose your code inside
a Document.

Additionally, a number of :py:mod:`~pylatex.section` containers are available,
which correspond to the standard `\\section` commands of LaTeX. As with documents,
these can be appended to. A :py:class:`~pylatex.section.Section` 
can further include a :py:class:`~pylatex.section.Subsection` or a 
:py:class:`~pylatex.section.Subsubsection` object.

Tables, Images, Math, etc.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PyLaTeX has a number of classes that are useful in generating 
difficult-to-format LaTeX code. See the API documentation and code examples for 
information on a specific environment.

Commands, Options, and Arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Although PyLaTeX has implemented many useful commands, it is easy to create a
custom command with the :py:class:`~pylatex.base_classes.commands.Command` class.
Commands can be supplied with `{}` arguments or `[]` options, with either a 
single option as a string, or multiple options in a list.

Additionally, Options and Arguments can be placed in an
:py:class:`~pylatex.base_classes.commands.Options` object or a 
:py:class:`~pylatex.base_classes.commands.Arguments` object.


Formatting Strings
~~~~~~~~
A number of functions are available in :py:mod:`~pylatex.utils` that are helpful in
formatting text. For example, :py:func:`~pylatex.utils.escape_latex` can be used on
a string to escape special characters in LaTeX (e.g. $, #, %). And 
:py:func:`~pylatex.utils.bold` and :py:func:`~pylatex.utils.italic` 
format text appropriately.


Extending PyLaTeX
-----------------
Because of all the base classes supplied by PyLaTeX, it is very easy to extend
its support in LaTeX features. Just pick one of the existing (base) classes
that fits best and extend that with the needed functionality.

All LaTeX objects come from 
:py:class:`~pylatex.base_classes.latex_object.LatexObject` , but it may be more useful
an object as one of its base subclasses, like an
:py:class:`~pylatex.base_classes.containers.Environment` or a command. Consult the 
API documentation to see the variety of base classes available for use.


Plain LaTeX Strings
-------------------
Although PyLaTeX contains classes and functions to make
generating LaTeX formatted text easy, at its core it is a nice wrapper around
string manipulations. This is why all the functions and classes that are
supplied by this library support normal strings as input. If at any point a
LaTeX feature that you need is not supported by this library, you can just make
a string with the LaTeX syntax you need and that string can simply be mixed in
with all the classes supplied by this library. Raw LaTeX strings can be appended
to containers, sections, or documents if none of PyLaTeX's functions work for you.
